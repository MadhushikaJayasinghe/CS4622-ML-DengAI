Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne tropical disease caused by the dengue virus. Symptoms typically begin three to fourteen days after infection. Dengue fever has become severe even in Sri Lanka causing many deaths. From 1 January to 7 July 2017, the Epidemiology Unit of the Ministry of Health (MoH) Sri Lanka reported 80 732 dengue fever cases, including 215 deaths. 

“DengAI Predicting Disease Spread” is an online challenge related to the disease Dengue which is hosted by drivendata.org to to predict the number of dengue cases each week (in San Juan and Iquitos) based on given data set of environmental variables describing changes in temperature, precipitation, vegetation etc. which cause for the dengue fever. Because it is carried by mosquitoes, the transmission dynamics of dengue are related to climate variable such as temperature and precipitation. Although the relationship to climate is complex, trying with various data pre-processing steps and different machine learning models, patterns and relationships could be identified.
